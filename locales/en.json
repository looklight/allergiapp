    "intro": "This app was born from personal experience. As someone with food allergies, I've always loved traveling and discovering new cultures through food.",
    "paragraph1": "During my travels, I learned that language barriers can turn a dining experience into a moment of anxiety. I started handwriting small cards listing my allergies, then printing them, and discovered how invaluable they were for communicating with waiters and chefs who didn't speak my language.",
    "paragraph2": "One simple gesture—showing a card—changed everything. Restaurant staff appreciated the clarity, I felt safer, and I could finally enjoy local cuisine without fear.",
    "paragraph3": "I created AllergiApp to bring this solution to anyone who needs it. It's free because traveling and enjoying the world's food should be a right for everyone, not a privilege.",
    "paragraph4": "If this app helps even one person enjoy an extra meal while traveling, it will have achieved its purpose.",
    "paragraph5": "If you appreciate this project and want to support it, every contribution helps cover development and maintenance costs, keeping it free and improving it over time. ❤️",
    "quoteText": "My mission? Make the world more accessible and help people with allergies explore it through food—safely and joyfully.",
