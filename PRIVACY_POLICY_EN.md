**Contact**: [Insert your email]

## What data we collect

### Data stored locally (on your device)
- Your selected food allergies
- Language preferences
- Downloaded translations

**This data is NEVER sent to our servers.** It stays only on your device.

### Anonymous analytics data
We use **Google Firebase Analytics** to improve the app. We automatically collect:
- Country and approximate city (from IP address)
- Device type and operating system
- Device language
- App usage (which screens you visit, which features you use)
- Statistics on most common allergies (aggregated and anonymous)
- Most downloaded languages

**We do NOT collect**: name, email, address, phone number, or other personally identifiable data.

### Translation services
When you download additional languages, allergen texts are sent to external translation services for translation. No personal data is sent.

## Why we collect this data
- **Local data**: To make the app work and display your allergies
- **Analytics**: To understand how to improve the app, which languages to add, which allergies are most common

## Legal basis (GDPR)
The collection of anonymous analytics is based on our **legitimate interest** in improving the app. Since the data is completely anonymous and aggregated, it does not identify you in any way.

## Data transfers
Anonymous analytics data is processed by **Google LLC** (USA) through Firebase. Google uses Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission to ensure data protection.

## Your rights
Since we do not collect personally identifiable data, we do not apply traditional GDPR rights (access, rectification, erasure) as we cannot associate analytics data with you specifically.

However:
- **By uninstalling the app**, you delete all local data (allergies, preferences)
- **In settings**, you can completely reset the app data
- You can contact us with privacy questions: [Insert email]

## Data retention
- **Local data**: Stored until you uninstall the app or manually delete it
- **Analytics**: Stored by Google Firebase according to their policies (typically 14 months)

## Changes to this policy
We may update this privacy policy. The last update date is shown at the top. We will inform you of significant changes through an app update.

## Children
The app is intended for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 16. If you are a parent and discover that your child has provided personal data (even though the app does not request it), contact us.
